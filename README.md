 # EXP 2

## Aim:
**To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types).**

## **Software:** 
Microsoft VSCode


## Theory:
_Data types define the type of data that a variable can hold, such as `integers`, `floating-point numbers`, `characters`, and more.We can also find the size of these data types by using `sizeof` keyword. These data types can be subdivided into three parts which are as follows_
+ **Basic Datatype**
+ **Derived Datatype**
+ **User-Defined Datatype**


 Storage class in C++ determines the characteristics of a variable.
C++ has 5 types of storage classes which are as follows:
+ **Auto**
+ **Extern**
+ **Mutable**
+ **Register**
+ **Static**

    cout << "size of int: " << sizeof(int) << " byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of float: " << sizeof(float) << " byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of double: " << sizeof(double) << " byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of short int: " << sizeof(short int) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of long int: " << sizeof(long int) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of unsigned char: " << sizeof(unsigned char) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of signed char: " << sizeof(signed char) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of unsigned int: " << sizeof(unsigned int) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of signed int: " << sizeof(signed int) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of unsigned long int: " << sizeof(unsigned long int) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of signed long int: " << sizeof(signed long int) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of unsigned short int: " << sizeof(unsigned short int) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of signed short int: " << sizeof(signed short int) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of unsigned long long int: " << sizeof(unsigned long long int) << "byte" << endl;
    cout << "size of bool: " << sizeof(bool) << "byte" << endl;
    return 0;
